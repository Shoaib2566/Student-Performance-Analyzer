# 🎓 Student Performance Analyzer

The **Student Performance Analyzer** is a data-driven academic performance management system designed to record, evaluate, and predict student performance across multiple assessments and subjects.  
It provides a comprehensive platform for **students**, **teachers**, and optionally **administrators**, enabling them to make informed decisions through data analysis and automated reporting.

---

## 🧩 Overview

This system is developed as part of an academic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. It applies fundamental programming and data management concepts to build a functional educational analytics tool.  

Key objectives:
- Automate the collection and analysis of student marks.
- Identify weak areas and performance trends.
- Provide teachers and students with data-driven insights.
- Support predictive analytics for future performance.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 🔐 User Authentication
- Separate registration and login for **students** and **teachers**.  
- Persistent user credential storage.  
- Secure login validation and role-based dashboards.

### 🗂️ Marks Management
- Teachers can **add**, **edit**, and **delete** student marks for various assessments (quizzes, assignments, exams, etc.).  
- Automatic updates to total, average, and subject-wise scores.  
- Persistent storage using file-based data management.

### 📊 Performance Analysis
- Automatic calculation of **total**, **average**, and **subject-wise** performance.  
- Ranking mechanism to identify top and low-performing students.  
- Real-time recalculation of rankings when data changes.

### ⚖️ Trend & Weakness Detection
- Highlights subjects with performance below a defined threshold.  
- Tracks student progress to identify **improving**, **declining**, or **stable** trends.  
- Teachers can view class-wide patterns of weakness.

### 📈 Predictive Analytics
- Estimates future performance using **weighted averages** and recent trends.  
- Provides predictive feedback to students and teachers for improvement planning.

### 🧾 Report Generation
- Generates detailed student performance reports with totals, averages, and trends.  
- Teachers can export reports for individuals or entire classes.  
- Students can view their reports directly from their dashboard.

### 🏛️ Administrative Insights *(optional)*
- Aggregates performance data across classes, subjects, or sections.  
- Compares performance between teachers, sections, or courses.  
- Generates institutional-level performance summaries.

## 🧠 DSA and Programming Concepts

The system is structured around key **DSA principles** for efficient data handling and computation:

| Concept | Application |
|----------|--------------|
| Arrays & Linked Lists | Storage and traversal of student and marks data |
| Queues | Managing user operations or report generation sequences |
| Stacks | Handling temporary computation during report creation |
| Sorting Algorithms | Ranking students by performance |
| File Handling | Persistent user and marks data storage |
| Search Algorithms | Retrieving user or record data quickly |
| Complexity Optimization | Ensuring efficient performance across large datasets |

## ⚙️ System Architecture

**Modules:**
1. **Authentication Module** — Handles user registration, login, and validation.  
2. **Marks Management Module** — Stores and updates marks for students.  
3. **Performance Calculator** — Computes totals, averages, and trends.  
4. **Ranking Engine** — Sorts students and identifies top/bottom performers.  
5. **Report Generator** — Creates text-based reports summarizing performance.  
6. **Predictive Module** — Analyzes previous results to estimate future scores.

---

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored persistently using **text or CSV files**, which include:
- User credentials (students and teachers)
- Marks records (subject, type, obtained marks, total marks)
- Generated reports and rankings

This structure can be extended to databases such as **SQLite** or **MySQL** for scalability.

## 🧮 Computational Design

The system follows a modular, function-based architecture emphasizing algorithmic efficiency.

| Operation | Description | Average Complexity |
|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Record Insertion | Adding new student marks | O(1) |
| Record Update | Editing or recalculating marks | O(n) |
| Sorting | Ranking students | O(n log n) |
| Search | Finding student by ID or name | O(log n) |
| Trend Analysis | Multi-record evaluation | O(n) |
